# acollier.dev

> ðŸ¤– My own personal website and corner on the internet.

I will eventually update this README with further information on what makes up this repository as well as deployment steps. For now, I would like to give credit where due:

- [Lee Robinson](https://github.com/leerob) for inspiration with various components from his [website](https://leerob.io). I have credited him where due in this repository
- [Marc Seitz](https://twitter.com/mfts0) for his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3u67UVDwzM) review of Lee Robinson's website. This what ultimately inspired me to build my own portfolio
- My friends on Discord who have supported me and watched me grow over the past few years as a developer. You know who you are!
